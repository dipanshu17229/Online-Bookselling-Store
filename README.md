# Online-Bookselling-Store

INTRODUCTION
This bookselling database management system project will keep a track of various books along with their titles, genre, authors, publishers, price, reviews, and their ranks in the rank list of books. A user can explore a variety of books arranged in genres with their respective prices and reviews. Each customer will be assigned an ID and a respective cartID which will uniquely identify the customer. It’ll also keep a record of the past orders placed for the books customerID wise so that if a customer wants to review the book he/she purchased some time ago then he/she can do so. Also, it’s very difficult in real-world scenarios to look for some books which are ranked amongst the top 20 or 50 highest-rated books. This database system will be a solution to this problem as well as will update the rank of books according to their avg_rating and number of sold copies in real-time.
